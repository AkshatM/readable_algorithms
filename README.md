# About

Don't you just hate when you're looking up a reference implementation of an algorithm written by someone else, and it makes no sense to you?  

This repository houses reference implementations for algorithms frequently asked about in technical interviews. They're designed to be *easy to read*,  *easy to remember* and *easy to port* to your problem. Performance is not a priority in these implementations.

At a future date, I might add data structure implementations.

# Algorithms Covered

1. Binary search
2. Breadth-first search
3. Depth-first search
4. Dijkstra's algorithm
5. In-order, pre-order and post-order traversal of binary tree
